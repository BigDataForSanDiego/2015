## Team Members :

David Diaz, San Diego State University, Department of Economics

Kai Lu, University of Southern California, Department of Computer Science

## Usage:

Because the app is deployed on Bluemix and the twilio account is a trial account
 (hey our budget was zero dollars) we will demo our app tomorrow (Saturday 10/10). 

## Background :

This code is deployed on IBM's BlueMix cloud and written in Python.

The current capabilities is for a user to message a number generated by Twilio,
 a message is returned and whatever was posted to Twilio is then posted to our Flask
based server then redirected to a public twitter account as a status update.

We believe a public twitter can be used to distibute information quickly from those who may
not be able to make a phone call due to network overload. Sms messages are far more efficient
and are unlikely to be not be delievered due to overload on the network.

## Libraries Used (Python):
* twilio
* twitter
* flask

## Files :
* requirements.txt a must have file for python programs, it lists all libraries required.
* runtime.txt a file to state which version of python is required.
* Procfile is the document the cloud seeks to run our code.
* manifest.yaml sets important variables required by the bluemix cloud.

## server.py

server.py is the script that makes everything work in this app.

In fact, it's quite short but in that script we are running 2 apis and
 a flask server.
